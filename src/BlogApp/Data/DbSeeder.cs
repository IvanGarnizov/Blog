                    Title = "Mountain glaciers are showing some of the strongest responses to climate change",
                    Content = "Mountain glaciers have long been a favorite poster child of climate change. The near-global retreat of glaciers of the last century provides some of the most iconic imagery for communicating the reality of human-driven climate change. But the scientific basis for their retreat has been less clear. Glaciers respond slowly to any climate changes, they are susceptible to year-to-year variations in mountain weather, and some of the largest are still catching up after the end of the so-called Little Ice Age. Scientists can connect climate change to the overall retreat of glaciers worldwide, but linking an individual glacier’s retreat to climate change has remained a subject of debate. The last report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded only that it was “likely” that a “substantial” part of mountain glacier retreat is due to human-induced climate change — a much weaker conclusion than for other things, like temperature. Now, using statistical techniques to analyze 37 mountain glaciers around the world, a University of Washington study finds that for most of them the observed retreat is more than 99 percent likely due to climate change. In the climate report’s wording, it is “virtually certain” that the retreat of these mountain glaciers is due to climate change over the past century. “Because of their decades-long response times, we found that glaciers are actually among the purest signals of climate change,” said Gerard Roe, a UW professor of Earth and space sciences. He is corresponding author of the study published Dec. 12 in Nature Geoscience, and presented this week at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting in San Francisco. The new study analyzes specific glaciers with a history of length observations, and nearby weather records of temperature and precipitation. The authors also sought different glacier locations, focusing on roughly seven glaciers in each of five geographic regions: North America, Europe, Asia, Scandinavia and the Southern Hemisphere. “We evaluate glaciers which are hanging on at high altitudes in the deserts of Asia as well as glaciers that are being beaten up by midlatitude storms in maritime climate settings,” Roe said. “The thickness, slope and area of the glaciers are different, and all of those things affect the size of the glacier length fluctuations.” Co-authors are Marcia Baker, a UW professor emeritus of atmospheric sciences and Earth and space sciences, and Florian Herla , an undergraduate student at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. The authors used statistical tools to compare the natural, weather-induced variations in a glacier’s length with its observed changes over the last 130 years, and establish a signal-to-noise ratio. They then use that to calculate the probability that observed retreats would have happened without any background change in the climate. The iconic Hintereisferner Glacier in Austria has retreated 2.8 km (1.75 miles) since 1880. Results show that climate change is extremely likely to be responsible for its retreat, with the probability that the changes are natural variations being less than 0.001 percent, or one in 100,000. Likewise, for the well-known Franz Josef Glacier in New Zealand, even though the glacier has experienced re-advances of up to 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) in a given decade, there is a less than 1 percent chance that natural variations could explain the overall 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) retreat in the last 130 years. The least significant retreats among the glaciers studied were for Rabots Glacier in northern Sweden, and South Cascade Glacier in Washington state, with probabilities of 11 and 6 percent, respectively, that their retreats might be natural variability. “South Cascade is at the end of the Pacific storm track, and it experiences a high degree of wintertime variability. Average wintertime snowfall generates about 3 meters (10 feet) of ice per year, whereas for glaciers in desert Asia, ice accumulation might be as low as 10 centimeters (4 inches) per year,” Roe said. “So they’re experiencing very different climate settings. As a result, their variability, and also their sensitivity to climate change, varies from place to place.” The method uses a signal-to-noise ratio that relies on observational records for glacier length, local weather, and the basic size and shape of the glacier, but does not require detailed computer modeling. The technique could be used on any glacier that had enough observations. Overall, the results show that changes in the 37 glaciers’ lengths are between two and 15 standard deviations away from their statistical means. That represents some of the highest signal-to-noise ratios yet documented in natural systems’ response to climate change. “Even though the scientific analysis arguably hasn’t always been there, it now turns out that it really is true — we can look at these glaciers all around us that we see retreating, and see definitive evidence that the climate is changing,” Roe said. “That’s why people have noticed it. These glaciers are stunningly far away from where they would have been in a preindustrial climate.”",

                    Title = "Rings around young star suggest planet formation in progress",
                    Content = "Rice University astronomers and their colleagues have for the first time mapped gases in three dark rings around a distant star. The rings mark spaces where planets are thought to have formed from dust and gas around the star. All the rings around HD 163296 are devoid of dust, and the international team of researchers led by Rice astronomer Andrea Isella is sure that planets, probably gas giants with masses comparable to Saturn, are responsible for clearing the outermost ones. But the inner ring has far more carbon monoxide than the other two, leading them to believe no planet exists there. That remains unexplained, he said. “The inner gap is mysterious,” Isella said. “Whatever is creating the structure is removing the dust but there’s still a lot of gas.” The work appears this week in Physical Review Letters. Only 20 years after the first exoplanet was spotted, astronomers are beginning to learn how planets form. Thousands of planets are now in the database, and scientists continue to improve their ability to analyze them for life-supporting characteristics. One aim of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, the world’s largest radio telescope used in the research, is to study protoplanetary systems. Their mechanics will help scientists understand how the planets like Earth formed. (Radio telescopes detect the unique electromagnetic waves emitted by elements and compounds in space, allowing them to be identified and measured.) The Rice-led team’s target star, nearly 400 light years away and best observed from the Southern hemisphere, is one of many known to have a large disk of dust and gas, Isella said. “Of the material that formed this disk, about 1 percent is dust particles and 99 percent is gas,” Isella said. “So if you only see the dust, you cannot tell if a ring was formed by a planet or another phenomenon. In order to distinguish and really tell if there are planets or not, you need to see what the gas is doing, and in this study, for the first time, we can see both the dust and the gas.” The outer rings are 100 and 160 astronomical units from HD 163296. (One unit is the distance from the center of the sun to Earth.) That’s much farther from the star than previously thought possible for planet formation. The star is too far from Earth for direct observation of the planets, yet evidence from the new study shows they are likely to be there, clearing dust and gas from the outer rings much like orbiting asteroids called shepherd satellites clear space between the rings around Saturn, Isella said. The inner ring, 60 astronomical units from its star, showed a much greater concentration of the three carbon monoxide isotopes measured relative to dust. “Theoreticians have proposed other phenomena that can form dark rings without planets,” Isella said. The researchers suspect one in particular: a lack of turbulence among non-ionized gas molecules in a magnetorotational instability “dead zone” that allows gas and dust to condense into a Saturn-like ring at the edge of the dark zone rather than a planet. The ring may also appear at the carbon monoxide frost line where the gas becomes cold enough to condense. The results laid the foundation for a new round of observations just starting at ALMA. Isella’s initiative to study 20 stars with protoplanetary disks is one of two “large programs” (from 24 proposals) accepted by the telescope. “‘Large program’ means that you ask for a lot of telescope time, more than 50 hours,” Isella said. “The other one they accepted will look at the emissions from a galaxy at the beginning of the universe. “It means our topic is considered by the astronomical community to be one of its highest priorities,” he said. Isella said the researchers will also return to HD 163296 to learn what other elements are in the disk and rings. Taking inventory will help them determine what kind of a planet might form from material that’s readily available. “If we know the chemistry of the material forming a planet, we can understand the chemistry of the planet,” he said. Proximity to the star is also important. For example, water has to be far enough from a star to freeze around grains and allow them to aggregate. There is a chance that systems like HD 163296 and HL Tauri, two of the first three (with TW Hydrae) observed by ALMA to show protoplanetary rings, are anomalies, he said. “Now the question is whether all the protoplanetary disks are like this. Do they all have this structure? There is the concern that this object and HL Tauri are freaks,” Isella said. Answers should come when the 20-star survey is completed. “We won’t begin to get the data until next September, but it will tell us a lot,” he said.

                    Title = "Mars Ice Deposit Holds as Much Water as Lake Superior",
                    Content = "Frozen beneath a region of cracked and pitted plains on Mars lies about as much water as what’s in Lake Superior, largest of the Great Lakes, a team of scientists led by The University of Texas at Austin has determined using data from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Scientists examined part of Mars’ Utopia Planitia region, in the mid-northern latitudes, with the orbiter’s ground-penetrating Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument. Analyses of data from more than 600 overhead passes revealed a deposit more extensive in area than the state of New Mexico. The deposit ranges in thickness from about 260 feet to about 560 feet, with a composition that’s 50 to 85 percent water ice, mixed with dust or larger rocky particles. At the latitude of this deposit — about halfway from the equator to the pole — water ice cannot persist on the surface of Mars today. It turns into water vapor in the planet’s thin, dry atmosphere. The Utopia deposit is shielded from the atmosphere by a soil covering estimated to be about 3 to 33 feet thick. “This deposit probably formed as snowfall accumulating into an ice sheet mixed with dust during a period in Mars history when the planet’s axis was more tilted than it is today,” said Cassie Stuurman of the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, a unit of the Jackson School of Geosciences. She is the lead author of a report in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The name Utopia Planitia translates loosely as the “plains of paradise.” The newly surveyed ice deposit spans latitudes from 39 to 49 degrees within the plains. It represents less than 1 percent of all known water ice on Mars, but it more than doubles the volume of thick, buried ice sheets known in the northern plains. Ice deposits close to the surface are being considered as a resource for astronauts. “This deposit is probably more accessible than most water ice on Mars, because it is at a relatively low latitude and it lies in a flat, smooth area where landing a spacecraft would be easier than at some of the other areas with buried ice,” said Jack Holt, a research professor with the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics and a co-author of the Utopia paper who is a SHARAD co-investigator and has previously used radar to study Martian ice in buried glaciers and the polar caps. The Utopian water is all frozen now. If there were a melted layer — which would be significant for the possibility of life on Mars — it would have been evident in the radar scans. However, some melting can’t be ruled out during different climate conditions when the planet’s axis was more tilted. “Where water ice has been around for a long time, we just don’t know whether there could have been enough liquid water at some point for supporting microbial life,” Holt said. Utopia Planitia is a basin with a diameter of about 2,050 miles, resulting from a major impact early in Mars’ history and subsequently filled. NASA sent the Viking 2 Lander to a site near the center of Utopia in 1976. The portion examined by Stuurman and colleagues lies southwest of that long-silent lander. Use of the Italian-built SHARAD instrument for examining part of Utopia Planitia was prompted by Gordon Osinski at Western University in Ontario, Canada, a co-author of the study. For many years, he and other researchers have been intrigued by ground-surface patterns there such as polygonal cracking and rimless pits called scalloped depressions — “like someone took an ice cream scoop to the ground,” said Stuurman, who started this project while a student at Western. In the Canadian Arctic, similar landforms are indicative of ground ice, Osinski noted, “but there was an outstanding question as to whether any ice was still present at the Martian Utopia or whether it had been lost over the millions of years since the formation of these polygons and depressions.” The large volume of ice detected with SHARAD advances understanding about Mars’ history and identifies a possible resource for future use. “It’s important to expand what we know about the distribution and quantity of Martian water,” said Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Deputy Project Scientist Leslie Tamppari of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “We know early Mars had enough liquid water on the surface for rivers and lakes. Where did it go? Much of it left the planet from the top of the atmosphere. Other missions have been examining that process. But there’s also a large quantity that is now underground ice, and we want to keep learning more about that.” Joe Levy of the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, a co-author of the new study, agreed. “The ice deposits in Utopia Planitia aren’t just an exploration resource. They’re also one of the most accessible climate change records on Mars,” he said. “We don’t understand fully why ice has built up in some areas of the Martian surface and not in others. Sampling and using this ice with a future mission could help keep astronauts alive, while also helping them unlock the secrets of Martian ice ages.”",

                    Title = "Radja Nainggolan strikes to give Roma the edge as Juventus's closest challengers",
                    Content = "Thumbing through the newspaper previews for Roma’s match against Milan, one might have come away with the impression that Italy was preparing not for a football match but rather an assault on King’s Landing. Like the put-upon peasants in Game of Thrones, columnists yearned for a less oppressive form of leadership. It was time, as La Repubblica put it, for the “One, True, Anti-Juve” to emerge. In the standings, there was nothing to choose between these two pretenders to the Serie A throne. Joint second on 32 points, they each trailed Juventus by seven. But the Milan manager, Vincenzo Montella, was quick to assert that Roma – on the basis of money spent, experience and stated ambitions – should be considered as favourites – and his opposite number concurred. “He is right when he says that Roma were built to win [now] and Milan weren’t,” Luciano Spalletti said. “That means I am doing normal things, while he is achieving extraordinary ones.” For all the media hyperbole, the tone of this pre-game back-and-forth was warm. It might not always have been so. Spalletti was the man who curtailed Montella’s time as a player with Roma, effectively blocking the striker’s path into the team when he started to deploy Francesco Totti as a false nine. “I deserved more but I’ve forgiven him,” Montella reflected, before going on to stress how much he had learned about management from his former boss. Spalletti received such comments with a smile, observing: “It’s easier to understand your parents when you become a parent yourself.” If Montella, in that analogy, is still a young father, then perhaps it was fitting that he should show up in Rome with the most youthful side seen in the Italian top flight this season. The average age of Milan’s starting XI on Monday night was only 23 years and 343 days old. Yet, these players hardly appeared overawed. Montella had set his team up to mirror Roma and through the first hour a midfield composed of Manuel Locatelli (18 years old), Mario Pasalic (21) and Andrea Bertolacci (25) more than held their own against Radja Nainggolan, Daniele De Rossi and Kevin Strootman. That the latter player was involved at all was a sore point for some. Strootman had initially been given a two-game suspension after he helped to instigate a sideline scuffle during his team’s win over Lazio, first splashing water over Danilo Cataldi and then collapsing meekly to the ground when the latter reacted by grabbing at his collar. The Dutchman’s punishment, however, was overturned, with the sporting court of appeals concluding that they could not prove he had intentionally exaggerated his tumble. The throwing of water had been witnessed by officials at the time and punished with a yellow card. If the court’s judgment represented a correct application of the letter of the law, then many would agree that the law is an ass. Either way, Strootman’s presence was not enough to elevate his team on Monday. He, just like his midfield team-mates, became bogged down in a stodgy game in which both teams struggled to impose themselves. Roma sorely missed the pace and directness of the injured Mohamed Salah, just as they had in the Derby della Capitale, and their only two real chances of the first half owed everything to the hard work of Edin Dzeko. A player transformed this season, the Bosnian made the most of his few touches – seeing one shot well saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma after he beat his man cutting in from the right, then flashing another wide by a hair after muscling his way into position to reach a long ball behind two defenders. In between those two opportunities, Milan missed a penalty. Only Wojciech Szczesny can know what prompted him to plunge into the legs of Gianluca Lapadula at a moment when Federico Fazio already seemed to be tracking the attacker’s run into the box effectively. But the keeper made amends by saving a tame effort from M’Baye Niang – the second time that the Frenchman has failed to convert from the spot in as many games. An injury to Bruno Peres just before the interval nudged Spalletti into an attacking shift as he brought on Stephan El Shaarawy to replace the wing-back. But there was no sense of inevitability to the goal with which Roma eventually broke the deadlock. Nainggolan brought down a team-mate’s headed clearance beautifully in the 62nd minute before surging away from Locatelli and curling a shot beyond Donnarumma from the edge of the D. It was a goal out of nowhere – an isolated piece of brilliance to punish a rare moment of inattention from the Milan defence. It was enough to settle this game. On balance, Roma had played better – and certainly once they had secured the lead they gave no sign of allowing Milan back into the game. They could draw encouragement, also, from their resilience. For the second match in succession, they had taken three points off a key rival, despite not performing to their full potential. Whether or not that is enough to make them title contenders is another question. Roma’s home form, certainly, looks imposing – they have won 11 straight at the Stadio Olimpico dating back to last season – but on Saturday they must take on Juventus in Turin. After all the hype of the last week, Tuesday’s papers seemed rather more subdued. Although some lauded Roma as a threat to the Old Lady’s crown, others were circumspect. Gazzetta dello Sport may have captured the moment best with a headline that asked: “Does an anti-Juve really exist?”",

They are parting because the recently demoted world No2 needs a lift that the six-times slam champion, struggling physically to keep up with the hectic pace of the Tour, can no longer deliver. It is a relationship that has run its course. If December is the season to be jolly for the rest of us, it is the traditional clearing month for tennis players as they retreat to their winter training camps before the new season. The Serb had been toweringly unconvincing in dodging questions about rumours of a break-up with Becker since the beginning of November, but the inevitable divorce gives him at least a momentum shift to chase down Murray as world No1 after a kaleidoscope of woes, on and off the court, had engulfed him since his shock early exit in the first week of Wimbledon. Djokovic had appeared edgy when sniping at his perceived British media enemies during the season-ending World Tour Finals in Greenwich last month. All the while, Becker, brought on board three years ago to vivify the player’s close-quarter tennis, sat broodingly in the player’s box, probably aware that his days were numbered. They won six grand slams together, including the annexation of the 2016 French Open that completed the set. Djokovic seemed to suffer an emotional crash after the landmark win over Murray in the final at Roland Garros. “The goals we set when we started working together have been completely fulfilled,” Djokovic said on Facebook. “I want to thank him for the cooperation, teamwork, dedication and commitment.” Becker replied on Twitter: “Thank U! We had the time of our life.” In Becker’s place now – as the game’s caravan moves to the first major of 2017, in Melbourne next month – sits not only the player’s long-term friend and coach, Marian Vajda, and his tight-knit back-up team, but a new mentor, the serene but distant life coach, Pepe Imaz. If the Spaniard – a fringe player on Tour in his playing days – has played a part in Becker’s removal, it would fit the Shakespearian scenario that has been building up around Djokovic all summer. Djokovic was teasingly candid about “private issues‚“ which “everybody goes through on a daily basis”. His wife, Jelena, was happily by his side again in London. Rapprochement would seem to have provided impetus for a fresh start on the court. One of the game’s all-time greats is on the prowl again.",

                    Content = "Last week, after seeing a clip of Madonna twerking on an episode of Carpool Karaoke, Piers Morgan pretended to vomit into a bucket. “Oh she makes my skin crawl,” he announced, before decreeing to the viewers of Good Morning Britain that “you can’t be 58 and prancing about like that”. Granted, it is a mere drop in the ocean of drivel to have come from the mouth of Piers Morgan (who, frankly, makes my skin crawl) over the years. Over the last few weeks, in fact. But in this instance, his views are shared by all too many. Because to exist as a woman in music, and – more importantly – to continue to do so beyond 30, is a deeply offensive thing. It’s a fact that Madonna has railed against often over the years, but never with quite such clarity and acerbic conviction as she did on Friday night at Billboard’s Women in Music event. While accepting her woman of the year award (a well-intentioned, somewhat cumbersome honour, but that’s a debate for another day), she announced, “I stand before you as a doormat. Oh, I mean, as a female entertainer.” She continued, “Thank you for acknowledging my ability to continue my career for 34 years in the face of blatant sexism and misogyny and constant bullying and relentless abuse.” She discussed her muse, David Bowie, who “embodied male and female spirit” and “made me think there were no rules. But I was wrong. There are no rules – if you’re a boy. There are rules if you’re a girl.” Those rules are as follows: “If you’re a girl, you have to play the game. You’re allowed to be pretty and cute and sexy. But don’t act too smart. Don’t have an opinion that’s out of line with the status quo. You are allowed to be objectified by men and dress like a slut, but don’t own your sluttiness. And do not, I repeat do not, share your own sexual fantasies with the world. Be what men want you to be, but more importantly, be what women feel comfortable with you being around other men. And finally, do not age. Because to age is a sin. You will be criticised and vilified and definitely not played on the radio.” It’s impossible to condense all the instances of gender inequality in music – both explicit and insidious – into one speech. But as far as scraping the surface of injustice goes, Madonna’s speech, in all its concise clarity, powered by decades of lived experience, was an important and moving thing indeed. The music industry has progressed in leaps and bounds when it comes to its treatment of women. Slowly but surely, female artists are being allowed to own their creativity, their sexuality and their artistic agency. Pop acts like Fifth Harmony and Little Mix are no longer held up as mere empty vessels into which to pour your male fantasies, the likes of Christine and the Queens occupy an androgynous, queer space previously only inhabited by men, and Beyoncé, the biggest pop star on the planet, has performed in front of a 20ft sign saying “FEMINIST”. This is progress in which Madonna – for all her flaws – has played, and continues to play, a significant part, but there’s still much to overcome. And her speech reminded us of that in a way that was (as is usually the case with the Queen of Pop) pretty hard to ignore. Madonna’s flaws, to be clear, are not insignificant. She’s suggested gay rights are “way more advanced than women’s rights”, as if the two are separate, never-overlapping entities in competition with one another; she’s praised Margaret Thatcher; she’s inappropriately compared her album leaking to rape and terrorism – an album she’d used Photoshopped images of black civil rights leaders to promote. She’s tripped up, that’s for sure. But she’s also remained an unapologetically empowered, innovative and evocative entertainer, and continued to joyously exist in a space so desperate to eject her. “I think the most controversial thing I have ever done is to stick around,” she told the audience at the end of her speech. It’s a tough call, coming from the woman who simulated an orgy atop the Last Supper table during her last tour – but she’s probably right. ",

                    Content = "On 24 October 1667, Samuel Pepys, arriving in Charing Cross too late for the theatre, went instead to visit some friends. There he saw “a Frenchman, Monsieur Prin, play on the Trump Marine”, an instrument which “doth so far out-do a Trumpet” and is “most remarkable; and at first was a mystery to me that I should hear a whole concert of chords together at the end of a pause”. Almost extinct today, Pepys’s trump marine is more commonly known as the tromba marina. It is indeed a most remarkable instrument. It can be over 2m tall, and has one long, thick playing string which is bowed, and a host of sympathetic (resonating) strings. Melodies are produced by touching the harmonic nodes of the playing string with the thumb. By the 17th century, the tromba marina had been around for at least 500 years and had grown from a simple monochord held horizontally to a tall, stately instrument with a buzzing foot-like bridge and sympathetic strings. Many surviving instruments were found in convents – it seems that tromba marinas were a staple of the northern European nun’s music box. Wind instruments would have been off-limits for women then, so it’s possible that tromba marinas were used as substitutes for trumpets. As the 17th century wore on, the instrument began to appear in secular public music-making, culminating in performances by the late 17th-century virtuoso Jean-Baptiste Prin, son of Pepys’s Frenchman, who entertained English audiences with his huge collection of tromba marinas and producing a treatise on how to play the instrument. This was its heyday – by the end of the 18th century it had all but disappeared from view. Like a trumpet, the tromba marina has a limited number of “good” harmonic notes. But, unlike a trumpet, the harmonics can’t be adjusted, which leads to a scale at odds with the various tuning temperaments of the day. Perhaps this is why it fell into obsolescence – the instrument simply didn’t fit with most other 18th-century instruments. In fact, maybe it only survived as long as it did because of its magical sonic and visual qualities. Clare Salaman plays the tromba marina at Spitalfields Music’s winter festival in London on 8 December as part of Sound House by the Society of Strange and Ancient Instruments. Sound House tours throughout 2017.",

                    Title = "Escape from Colditz 75th Anniversary Edition Review – The Great Escape",
                    Content = "Despite having reviewed a fair number of board games now on this site, I’ve not once reviewed a game where you roll dice to move. It wasn’t something I had thought about until I played Escape from Colditz. Even though my childhood was filled with games like Monopoly where you had to roll dice to move, that particular mechanic has been mostly fazed out of the modern board game industry. Turns out a lot of people don’t like having something as simple as moving dictated by fickle dice. Escape from Colditz is a product of a different time, though. It does indeed have dice which will be tossed across the table every single turn, and as such a large portion of its gameplay comes down to getting really bloody lucky, or being screwed over by hooded specter of Chance. It’s a throwback to a different era, but it still manages to stand firm. Here’s the idea; 1-5 players will take on the role of Escape Officers who must get two of their colored POW pawns out of Colditz castle, escaping into the wilderness and hopefully to safety. They must do this in fifty rounds, and attempting to stop them is a Security Officer who takes control of the numerous black German playing pieces, the guards of the castle who must arrest POWs and generally just try to make sure they don’t manage to break out in spectacular fashion. What intrigues me the most about Escape from Colditz is the blend of competitive and co-operative gameplay. On the one hand, it’s every man and woman for themselves as only one person can technically win, but on the other hand as an Escape Officer it feels like you and your comrades against the German guards. In most instances, I found that as the game drew to a close if it was clear that only one or two Escape Officers had a chance of winning everybody else would ditch their own attempts to escape in favor or helping those players. Escape items can be traded at will so the last few rounds would see people desperately tossing cards across the table, and sacrificing their pieces to clear a path for whomever had the best chance of making it out. Everybody wants to win, but nobody wants to see the Security Officer come out on top. In fact you could even play it as a co-operative game from the start, although I imagine whoever is playing as the German’s would not be very appreciative of that choice. The board itself is split into three primary areas; the inner courtyard, the outer courtyard and outside the castle itself. This is important because the location of a playing piece determines what can be done. For example, in the inner courtyard a German guard can only arrest a POW if that POW’s Escape Officer happens to be holding escape equipment, such as a rope. Meanwhile outside of the castle itself a POW can always be arrested since they aren’t supposed to be there. Let’s start with the inner courtyard, since that’s where you begin. In the center is an appel area, which is completely safe; any POW here can’t be bothered for some unknown reason. On the edge of the courtyard is a series of rooms that are the source of the many pieces of equipment you’ll need to make your escape, each one bearing a symbol like rope, wire cutters or papers. To get one of these items you need to have two POWs in one of the rooms, or one in each of the two rooms with the symbol. With that done you simply announce that you’re making the item, take the appropriate card and then put both POWs back into the appel. Once you’ve got your mitts on some gear you’ve got to be careful, though, because at that point guards can arrest you within the inner courtyard. An arrest is made by a guard simply moving into the same space as a POW, at which point the POW is sent to solitary. There’s only two ways for a player to get their pieces out of solitary; either through the use of an Opportunity card, or by rolling doubles, at which point a single point of movement can be used to release a POW. If you’re captured outside of the main courtyard not only do you have to lose a random piece of equipment but you’ll also be sent to the outer solitary building. This is troublesome because when you roll a double and release one of your pieces all of your remaining movement points have to be spent to move that piece back into the inner courtyard, or else it becomes eligible for being arrested yet again. Of course, if no guard happens to be nearby and you still have some equipment left it could be the perfect opportunity for an escape attempt. But there is an upside to being arrested: any German guard that arrests a player’s piece is sent to the commander’s office afterward. At the end of the Security Officer’s turn a guard is then moved from the office over to the barracks where they can then be redeployed at the cost of one movement point to any guard post. This essentially takes one guard out of the game for an entire turn, which is exactly why it’s also possible to get deliberately arrested by ramming one of your pieces into a guard, basically starting a fight in order to remove one of the Security Officer’s pieces. A smart player can use this to clear the way for an escape, hopefully giving them the time needed to pull off something spectacular. Speaking of which let’s talk about actually making an escape. Spaces with a number on them indicate that a rope is needed, either one for space marked 30 or two for those marked 60. Inspection points can be walked through provided you have some papers, while locked doors can be sorted out with a key, obviously. There’s also fences where wire cutters will make a handy-dandy exit, presumably in a humorous human shape. Whatever way you choose to go you’ll have to spend the appropriate piece of equipment to do it, so if you clamber out a window that’s your rope gone. Likewise, if you venture through a door you can’t just take the key with you for some reason, so best be sure the plan is going to work out or else you’ll be wasting time and resources. Whenever you move through a window or use wire-cutters and escape token will be placed there which allows any of your pawns to use those escapes without needing to spend the corresponding equipment type. Other players can’t make use of these, though, for reasons that will never be explained. You’ve got to be careful, however, because guards can also follow you through windows and holes in the fence, and can opt to remove the token as they do so, cutting off the escape route. Another reason to be careful is that escape markers allow guards to enter the rooms around the edge of the inner courtyard, which are normally off limits to them. Obviously, doors and inspection points don’t need escape markers, but guards are free to pass through them. Once you make it outside of the castle itself there’s also search lights to avoid, shown on the board as orangey yellow spaces. Should any POW end the turn in one of these spaces they are immediately sent to solitary, so avoiding them is obviously a case of hoping you’ll roll well. Speaking of rolling grabbing those dice and chucking them across the table grants the possibility of picking up an Opportunity card for the Escape Officers or a Security Card for whoever is controlling the guards. Roll a movement of five or lower and you can draw a card. These cards add a little extra layer to the game, introducing stuff like tunnels, quickly traveling to rooms or even letting guards shoot a POW outside of the castle, removing that piece entirely from the game. Each player can only hold three cards at any time, though, which creates plenty of moments where you have to carefully choose what to use and what to discard. Yup, everything comes back to rolling those dice. The random movement can create some dramatic scenarios, but it can also leave you feeling incredibly angry. Several times I executed wonderful escape plans, timed to perfection so that the Security Officer was busy dealing with other players, and yet despite having a seemingly clear run with the nearest guard some distance away a simple change of fortune lost me the game. It’s frustrating to come so close to winning because you played well, and then lose because of a bad roll or two. And yet…on the other hand, the unpredictability it creates can be a boon. As infuriating as it can be for the player who gets taken down, watching the Security Officer suddenly rolling doubles and sprinting madly across the board to tackle a POW about to escape is kind of cool. The dice also create a few pacing issues in two players games because it can get to a point where the Escape Officer is just waiting to roll a high enough number to get across the yard without being arrested or to do something else. With more players this becomes less of a situation since somebody should almost always be getting a chance to advance their plans, but it’s still not perfect. And do you know what else is cool? The interaction between players. For starters the only truly hidden information is what Security and Opportunity cards are being held, so the Security Officer is always aware of what equipment players are picking up. It becomes a game of bluffing and patiently waiting. If you just grab a couple of ropes and head for the nearest window it’s rather obvious what your plans are and the Security Officer will react accordingly. It’s better to start gathering extra equipment before also ramming a few POWs into guards in order to clear the better. And then there’s the fact that timing your own escape while another player tries to execute their plan will provide the distraction you need, although the Security Officer does have a lot of guards at his or her disposal so they can split forces. It creates a fun atmosphere where everyone is waiting for everyone else to make the first move. There can be long periods of relative peace in Escape from Colditz followed by an explosion of action triggered by one person deciding to launch their plan. To wrap up this review I have to stop and chat about the packaging because it’s clear Osprey wanted to make this game feel a little bit special. It starts with the lid itself which is thick and actually quite weighty. Inside you’ll find not only the rules but a history book as well that provides some background on the real Colditz castle. Underneath the board sits a brown box that’s one in the style of a red Cross parcel. You also get a couple of other cool historical items, including a postcard that was written by one of the prisoners. It’s a beautiful presentation that feels like it was done to pay some respect to the very real people and events this game is based upon. It’s also nice to see the game’s original rules included as well, in case you fancy trying those out. So let’s bring this sloppy review together, shall we? I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed Escape from Colditz. With its little colored pawns and dice it feels like a jump back in time, but the way its gameplay mechanics come together create some really fun scenarios. The player interaction is what really makes it enjoyable, though. There’s a great sense of camaraderie and yet mistrust amongst the Escape Officers, and as the Security Officer attempting to keep everyone under control is really fun. I can’t say it’s brilliant or one of my favorite games and therefore I don’t feel it quite earns a full recommendation sticker. I don’t think it’s one of those games I would tell you that you need to play or go out and buy. But it is damn good, and if the theme appeals to you then go for it. Just make sure you’ve got about 3-4 people to play it.",

                    Title = "Dishonored 2 Review – Dishonorable Problems, Honorable Gameplay",
                    Content = "hot, promptly killing himself in the process. Hell, you can even use your clone to avoid fall damage by summoning her on the ground and performing an aerial assassination. That’s not even to mention things like stun mines, grenades, sleep darts, howling arrows and more. How about killing a guard, sticking a stun mine to him and then tossing the corpse off a building so his comrades come investigate and wind up getting electrocuted for their trouble? Rewiring a sentry turret so it guns everyone down? Yup. Stopping time and going on a Blink killing spree? Cool. Stopping time, strapping a mine to someone and then starting time again? Awesome. Irritated than Mesmerize can only captivate up to three people at once but rooms often contain more than that? No problems, combine it with Domino and you can have entire buildings full of gormless guards. There’s a lot to play with here and most of the fun comes from doing just that. Plus with a different set of powers available there is a reason to go for a second run. Much of the game’s genius comes from its staggeringly good level design. They aren’t the biggest, although they are considerably larger than Dishonored’s, but they’re packed with routes, nooks, crannies and secrets worth discovering, as well as being very memorable. The obvious standout is Jindosh’s mansion, a sprawling complex where pulling levers alters the layout, transforming rooms. I spent two hours on this level alone, investigating everything I could. That’s followed up by a level with horrendous dust storms that massively reduce your visibility, a blessing and a curse since it means guards can’t spot you, but you can’t spot them until it’s too late. Another great example is a level where you can gain safe passage by bringing the leader of one faction to the other, depending on who you side with. Or you can break into both areas and gather clues to solve a riddle to unlock a large door. Or better yet you can even skip a good portion of it all by just solving the riddle yourself, although be warned it’s actually pretty damn difficult and should test your grey matter quite nicely. In other words Arkane have taken the already impressive level design of Dishonored and improved it, adding in small gameplay tweaks. Like before you can get through the entire game without killing a soul if you wish, including the primary targets. A bit of investigation will always reveal a non-lethal alternative, like stripping someone of their powers rather than just shoving a knife into their skull. The game does a nice job of giving your targets little glimmers of good, too, to make you second guess what you wish to do with them. With that said, much like the original Dishonored most of the people you kill along the way are forgettable fodder, which is a shame. It’s also a shame that despite trying to give these targets some moral grey areas and therefore bring some subtlety into the mix the game still insists on using the chaos rating system, whereby the more you kill the higher your chaos rating. Maybe it’s just me, but really basic good/bad meters like that feel daft except in certain circumstances. There’s even the occasional side-mission to be found within levels, too, giving you another reason to have a good poke around. These will typically unlock helpful things, like the electricity on carriage lines being shut off so you can walk along them,. Black market shops are also scattered around, giving you a chance to purchase upgrades and supplies. Or you could just rob them blind if you prefer. If that wasn’t enough then Runes and Bonecharms will ensure you scour the levels like a madman looking for the last Wine Gum. Runes are the things you need to acquire new powers and upgrade existing ones, so it’s always worth grabbing those, while Bonecharms provide small passive bonuses, such as being able to regenerate your mana or slightly better health gains when drinking a potion. Bonecharms can also be broken down and their parts used to craft new ones. To find these you’ve got a handy-dandy heart. Yup, an actual heart that you can hold. Dishonored veterans will already know what it does, but basically the heart will show the locations of all Runes and Bonecharms in the level, so if you don’t fancy checking everywhere to find them then just whip the heart out and let it guide you. But far more awesome is how pulling the left trigger with the heart equipped will cause it to comment on wherever you are at the moment. Point it at an enemy and it will provide some insight into who they are, which brings an extra layer of morality to the game. Some people are just jerks who you’ll want to slice up regardless of whether you’ve only been playing as a pacifist up to that point, while others you’ll want to leave alone. You could devote an entire playthrough to being a supernatural judge, jury and executioner. Even the combat has been mildly improved so that it feels better. It has been kept simple, too: block an enemy strike at the right time and you can go in for an instant kill or choke, but try to take on multiple opponents and you’ll be cut to ribbons. Head-on assaults are all about being smart, then, such as rewiring a Wall of Light so it’ll free the enemy, or picking them off with your crossbow or pistol before getting into a sword duel, and knowing when to retreat. That last bit is key as I’ve seen a lot of reviews criticising the combat for how it feels clumsy when battling multiple enemies, but that’s deliberate, I feel. You might be a superpowered assassin, but you’re soft and squishy, too. When you bring everything together it is gloriously fun and satisfying. levels have lots of verticality and are somehow designed to accommodate everything, from players who want to use Blink to take advantage of that verticality to those who want to stick to the ground to those who refuse the supernatural powers at the start of the game and want to play purely as a normal human with an aptitude for turning other human’s into shish-kebabs. I know I’m repeating myself but the level design is just brilliant. Personally I’m a stealth fan with a penchant for non-lethal which can sometimes curb my desire to go nuts with the systems, so I fired up a second-playthrough specifically to play with everything and had a blast from start to finish. The original Dishonored was guilty of having lots of cool stuff for people who wanted to murder everything and very little for stealthy, non-lethal players like me, but Dishonored 2 solves that with powers like Mesmerize and Domino. Visually the game has taken a big leap forward since the original Dishonored while still retaining that unique style which I can’t even begin to put into words. Some issue with texture streaming damages this, though, as do a small host of other graphical hiccups. It’s a shame because otherwise the game can look gorgeous at times. The audio is likewise a mixed bag of great and bad. Individual sound effects are superb, such as the clashing of steel on steel or the low-down bark of your pistol as it demolishes someone’s brains. The voice acting is generally quite good, too. However, where the problem lies is in the sound mix. Enemies a floor up or down will often sound like they’re walking right beside or behind you due to how loud the footsteps, while sometimes guards several rooms away can be heard very clearly. It can also be hard to tell where sounds are coming from, which is vital in a game like this if you want to stay hidden or get the drop on people. When choking out a foe there’s also a series of very loud footsteps that almost block out anything else. What all of this leads to is a disorienting soundscape that constantly seeks to make you jump because you thought someone was right behind you. Up close and personal the sound is fine, but at a distance and when layered it’s got a lot of work to be done. So what other problems does the game have? Well, for starters the story feels almost like an afterthought at times, not helped by the incredibly rushed intro that introduces Emily and Corvo before Emily is tossed off the throne by a strange relative with incredibly powers. Cue a classic revenge story, either as Emily attempting to reclaim her throne or as Corvo attempting to just be a bloody badass. It’s okay stuff but does suffer from a lack of interesting characters and is otherwise just “eh” in how its told. Both Emily and Corvo ar fully voiced now but it seems Arkane didn’t want to make them full characters to go with it, so what we’ve ended up with is a strange mixture of silent protagonist and person who occasionally butts in. Their personalities are deliberately kept on the down-low and that’s a shame. Corvo already went an entire game without speaking a word, and he doesn’t really get to say much more here. Still, if the game doesn’t do the grand overarching story as well as it should it does at least do the small ones reasonably well. There are notes, books and diaries all over the city of Karnaca that you can ignore, which would be daft since they often contain helpful clues, or that you can read and enjoy. Plus there’s some nice moments to be found, like a pair of sisters talking about stealing silver to escape the city. Input lag is also a pain in the ass. It doesn’t make the game unplayable, but there’s a noticeable slowness to the controls that is annoying. You’ll adjust as time goes on, but it should never have been an issue in the first place. And while I personally didn’t experience many bugs or problems it’s worth noting that a lot of people have. The legend that is Jim Sterling, for example, pointed out in his own quite negative review that in one instance his target just randomly died during the level, while Reddit and Steam are filled with folk encountering trouble. As for the PC version it seemingly has a lot of problems and should probably be avoided until Arkane have sorted it out. As always, though, I review a game based on my own experiences with it, and from that perspective Dishonored 2 is absolutely wonderful. It’s a safe sequel in many regards, opting to stick to what everyone loved about the first game rather than introducing any radical new concepts, but it takes that original formula and refines it beautifully. The levels are memorable and stand as some of the best examples of how to design an environment for gameplay in recent memory, while the core gameplay is as satisfying and fun as it ever was, improved by the addition of some cool new powers and level gimmicks. The story could be stronger and the input lag needs sorted, but from my experience this is one of the best games of the year. And yet….and yet I almost didn’t give it a recommendation. I feel the need to be harsher and more critical of games being launched in poor states because it’s something that frustrates me hugely about the industry at the moment. But I also moved away from a score in my reviews for a reason, and the recommended sticker is supposed to be for games that may have huge problems too, but that I still think are worth playing, and Dishonored 2 falls into that category perfectly. It needs work, but Dishonored 2 is honestly some of the best fun I’ve had all year. So that brings me to the conclusion, and it’s a complicated one; it’s a game I absolutely recommend you play, yet it’s one that I also recommend you wait to play. My experience was pretty smooth on console, but it would be idiotic to ignore the many, many people who are struggling with poor framerates. If you’re a PC gamer, definitely wait for some patches to hit. If you’re a console gamer it’s harder to call. It’s up to you. Just know that the game beneath the issues is spectacular. It’s just a shame Bethesda have upheld their legacy of pushing out unfinished games.",

Of course Gears of War wasn’t the sole factor in my decision to go with the Xbox 360, but it was a very large part of it. I can’t remember how many videos I watched of it, or reviews I read. Regardless, I became enthralled with Epic’s cover-based, horror shooter. Skip ahead a full ten years and we’re on to our fifth game in the series, and a new developer. Being a developer taking the reigns for any big series cannot be easy. 343 Industries are a prime example, having taken on the Halo franchise. With this new power comes a hard decision to make: do you stick closely to the original template to sate fans but risk derision for a lack of innovation, or do you attempt to radically alter the tried and tested formula, potentially angering the existing fanbase who just wanted more of the same? In this case the Coalition have opted to do both, creating in the process a handing of the torch, so to speak. Gears 4 picks up some 25 years after Gears of War 3, and follows one J.D. Fenix, son of everyone’s favorite grizzled badass Marcus Fenix. Accompanying the blonde-haired J.D. is his best friend Dell and outsider Kait. Having served with the COG previously Gears of War 4 picks up six months after J.D. and Dell have abandoned the COG forces and are now working with the outsiders, groups of people who refuse to live in the COGs designated towns. In other words although it isn’t stated outright in Gears 4 the COG have perhaps become a little too big for their boots. It’s a beautifully paced, intense, fun campaign that sadly trips at the final hurdle, delivering a crap ending that so focused on setting up the new trilogy that it forgets to give us a satisfying finale. The last level is quite fun but then you run into a dull boss that’s beaten far too easily, which is followed up by a very brief sequence that riffs too heavily on a moment from Gears of War 2 and then…it just ends. There’s no suitable build-up, it happens far, far too quickly and it simply falls flat. Hell, by the time I’d reached this point in the campaign I honestly thought it was ramping up nicely and that there was going to be at least another couple of hours to go. It’s sloppy writing, to say the least. It also points to a problem with length. I’m not opposed to games being short if it feels right, but in the case of Gears of War 4 the runtime of around 6-hours didn’t feel correct at all. But hey, the rest of the narrative is quite, if basic, amounting to two rescue missions across the six hours or so of gameplay. While the previous games had an attitude that could only be described as “bro-dude” which created a strangely compelling aura of cheesiness Coalition have attempted to shift Gears 4’s J.D. toward the realms of Nathan Drake. He and Dell are much more about quipping than being grizzled hard-asses forged in the flames of war. And to be completely honest, I sort of miss the tone of the original games. They were incredibly cheesy and so pumped up on testosterone that even the Hulk would take a step back, but it worked. Gears of War was all about the bombast mixed in with some surprisingly touching moments, even if they were handled with all the tact of a toddler have a tantrum because you wouldn’t let them stick their fingers in a socket. Compared to them J.D., Dell and Kait are quite different. I liked them, and yet something is missing. They aren’t as funny as the writers seem to think, and the quippy dialogue feels like it’s trying too hard, whereas Marcus, Dom, Cole and Damon’s banter felt natural. With that said this new team does have good chemistry and I’m comparing them to a group that I spent three games with. Now we enter minor spoiler territory. I say minor because this was shown in the trailers, and the only reason I want to talk about it is to bring up a little bit of meta-commentary going on, or at least what I perceive to be meta-commentary. Still, if you want to avoid any sort of spoilers whatsoever, no matter how predictable it might be, skip to the next paragraph. Still here? Okay then. Unsurprisingly Marcus Fenix joins the crew fairly early on in the journey, and he’s gruffer than ever, now with an added layer of surliness. Putting aside the sheer pleasure of seeing the iconic soldier back his presence creates an interesting dialogue on the new Gears vs the old. There’s a rift between Marcus and J.D., you see, one that mirrors the bad relationship between Marcus and his father. What this creates is an interesting commentary that can be viewed as the new Gears of War (J.D.) vying for the approval of the old guard. It’s also a very clear signal of intent from Coalition, indicating that while they want to appease the old fans they do very much intend on passing the torch. This is still a gears of War game and that means incredibly tight cover mechanics, active reloads and fun firefights. Not too much has been tweaked here, leaving the basics intact. Tapping A will still slam you into cover with much more grace than J.D.’s big frame would imply, nailing an active reload still brings a smirk to your face and chainsawing a foe to death is still freaking awesome. But that isn’t to say Coalition haven’t add a few things here and there. Take the new cover-based combat mechanics, for instance; now you can reach over cover and grab anybody on the other side, hauling them over for an execution unless they counter it. This is fun in the singleplayer, but is much more interesting in the multiplayer. There’s also new weapons, like one that launches richocheting blades of death or a shotgun that fires when you pull the trigger and again when you release the trigger. It’s small changes, but to be honest I didn’t find myself caring because I was too busy slipping back into the sleek combat. There’s been a lot of cover-based shooters over the year. It’s become a staple of the gaming industry, and yet somehow despite it being some ten years since the first Gears of War chainsawed its way onto store shelves nobody does it better. As for the enemy, it’s a case of what’s old is new again as the writers have found a way of bringing back the Locust horde, albeit in modified form thanks to some shenanigans involving that old standby Imulsion. Now they’re a bunch of tentacle monsters named the Swarm that look like they’ve been ripped out of some hentai movie. Don’t worry, though, while you may be facing off against standard grubs in slightly different garb there’s quite a few new enemy types as well, like a leaping beast that shots quills and shambling ape-things that launch living missiles from chests, and not one of them is going to try to insert their tentacles in anyone’s nether regions. Hentai can be scary, people. There’s quite a bit of emphasis on foes that force you out of cover, too, mixing in with the regular grunts to create some great scenarios where you’re forced out of your hidey-hold and straight into a barrage of enemy gunfire. And then there’s the new Scions who are big lads wielding equally big weapons, but more importantly they can also buff their friends, making them harder to kill. Naturally that makes Scions an immediate threat worth focusing on first. There’s also robotic COG foes who get dropped off in cool pods before trying to introduce your face to heavy metal. They’ll be your fodder for the first while and frankly just aren’t as interesting to fight as the Swarm. Still, with both them and the Swarm in play there’s quite a lot of enemy variety to be found here. Frankly the harder challenge is just making sure you don’t constantly get distracted by how damn good Gears of War 4 looks. This is a beautiful game with amazing lighting and a good eye for environmental design, capturing some of the classic gloominess from the first game and mixing it with the more vibrant palette of Gears of War 3. Everywhere you look there’s something awesome to cast your eye on, and the level of detail is impressive. The campaign follows the traditional pace of the previous games, so it’s a case of moving from area to area, clearing out the enemies and occasionally enjoying a few moments of slower movement where exposition gets delivered. Excellent pacing serves to keep the entertainment flowing as you move from fun battle to fun battle, whether it’s the simple joys of a nice arena and a good enemy mix or one of the more intense set piece moments. Speaking of which there are a number of sequences where you fight through an epic storm that ravages the planet’s surface. Insane winds will whisk grenades and other projectiles away, while lightening creates a moving obstacle course. It’s an expertly judged thrill-ride that’s only let-down by that sloppy ending. Well, maybe one thing. Possibly two things. I’m quite torn on a few segments where horde mode suddenly gets introduced into the game, asking players to defend against waves of enemies. You’ll be given a fabricator that can generate defenses like turrets in order to prepare yourself for the oncoming onslaught. The fabricator feels like something jammed into the campaign solely to then cram Horde moments into campaign as well, and so while I did enjoy these segment their presence is ultimately jarring. If the campaign attempts to pass the torch the multiplayer refuses to hand it over at all, sticking squarely to its chainsaws and Gnasher shotguns. This is still the mad, barmy game of bouncing from cover to cover like some sort of possessed pinball that’s managed to grow hands with which to wield a shotgun. A couple of new modes do help spruce things up quite a bit, however, starting with Dodgeball. Despite its name there are no balls being tossed about, rather the name comes from the idea that in dodgeball if you catch the ball an eliminated player can reenter the game. In other words in Dodgeball every time you kill one of the five enemy team members one of your own eliminated crew can get back into the fight. This creates some great comeback moments when the last member of a team manages to kill a few enemy in quick succession, evening out the odds. The other mode is Arms Race which riffs off of the Call of Duty mode wherein getting X amount of kills with a weapon moves you on to the next gun. Here the idea is that everytime three kills is achieved the entire team is shifted over to a new gun at the same time. It’s an intriguing idea, but its also highly annoying. Lining up a shot with a sniper rifle only to jump over to a shotgun just as you pull the trigger is hardly fun. Escalation makes up for this mistake by introducing a simple mode where you battle for control of three zones. Each zone will gather points for the team that holds it, but the kicker is that if all three zones get captured by the same team it’s game over. This provides a good emphasis on teamwork, especially since zones are near spawns, making getting that final area under control difficult. There’s also now a Competitive multiplayer list that tones down weapon damage and removes auto-aim. Aimed at the more player who considers themselves more elite it’s quite enjoyable, although personally I didn’t find myself spending much time with it. We finish up with an expanded Horde mode, which is fitting since the Gears series popularized the idea, even if it didn’t create it. Coalition have built on the foundation laid by Gears 3 and Gears of War: Judgement, expanding on the classes by giving them skills in the form of cards that can be bought via real money (boooooo!) or earned in-game. The more you play with a class the more cards you can equip, and that’s important because they can really, really increase your abilities. A sniper can massively boost headshot damage, for example, and Scouts can nearly double their health. Using the fabricator and power gathered from the corpses of fallen foes you create defenses and deploy them, setting up shop where you think is best on the map, which means one map can actually feel quite different depending on where you dump the fabricator. Toss in a bunch of modifiers that do things like making you kill enemies in a certain amount of time and you’ve got the recipe for something truly special. Horde was already addictive, and this just ups the ante. Although it’s something of a copout opinion it has to be said nevertheless; if you love Gears then you’re going to love Gears of War 4. However, if you weren’t a fan of the series this may actually be enough to sway you thanks to the lack of dudeness. Of course if you found that dudeness strangely endearing J.D. Fenix and chums may not be as fun as Marcus and his cohorts. Does Gears of War 4 manage to match that awesome moment when you chainsaw a Locus in half for the first time in the original Gears of War? No. It’s a pretty safe sequel which is hardly surprising. Coalition have been handed the reigns to one of Microsoft’s biggest selling points and they clearly didn’t want to upset the ‘ol applecart. Still, what they have done is taken an already superb formula, polished it a bit and then tossed in a couple of little things here and there, like some fun new multiplayer modes and an improved Horde mode.",
